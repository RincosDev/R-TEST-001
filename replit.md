# R-TEST-001 Project

## Overview
This is a fresh GitHub import from https://github.com/RincosDev/R-TEST-001. 

**Current State**: The repository is empty - it only contains initial git configuration files (.gitattributes). No application code, dependencies, or project structure has been imported.

## What This Means
The imported GitHub repository doesn't contain any project code yet. To proceed, you'll need to either:
1. Add code to the GitHub repository and re-import, or
2. Start building your project here from scratch

## Recent Changes
- **November 4, 2025**: Initial import from GitHub - repository found to be empty

## Next Steps
Let me know what kind of project you'd like to create, and I can help you set it up. For example:
- Web application (frontend/backend)
- Command-line tool
- API server
- Or any other type of project

## Environment
- Replit NixOS environment (stable-25_05 channel)
- Expert mode enabled
